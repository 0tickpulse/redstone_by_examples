# What is Redstone

## The term "Redstone"

The term "Redstone" can be used to indicate multiple things - firstly, in Minecraft, there is the `minecraft:redstone` item, which is a red flat transparent block. People use this meaning a lot - for example: "Hey, I just mined a stack of Redstone!" In this guide, this specific item is referred to as "Redstone dust". However, we will use another meaning - referring to the technique of using the interaction between certain types of blocks to achieve certain behaviors.

Think of Redstone as Minecraft's electricity - they have many similarities. They both have components and switches, and wiring and both require logic and thinking.

## Why learn Redstone

This question is asked a lot - why are we spending so much time learning about a few weird blocks in a video game? If you have done Redstone before, you would know that there are many good reasons to learn it.

### The knowledge is transferrable

The knowledge, techniques, skills, and habits that you will use while doing Redstone are transferrable. You will learn concepts like boolean logic, which can be transferred to subjects like engineering, computer science, and programming. In addition, while learning and building Redstone, you will be consistently using your problem-solving skills.

### It's fun

Although this is subjective, it can be extremely fun to learn, especially when you're creating real things while learning. Therefore, by learning Redstone, you are having fun learning real-life things while playing a game you love.

### It's powerful

Redstone can be extremely powerful. You can use it to create small things that generally enhance your build (such as a lighting system or a door), or go full-on out and create truly insane machines (such as a [working 3D renderer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFRlnNci3Rs))!
