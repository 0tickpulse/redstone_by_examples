# This guide

This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of Minecraft.

Contraptions are tested in Minecraft Java 1.19.2, on a Paper server. Since it is tested on Paper and not Vanilla, things Paper affects like update order are not mentioned here. (It is an advanced feature that no beginner should learn anyway)
