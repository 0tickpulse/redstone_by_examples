# This guide

This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of Minecraft.

Contraptions are tested in Minecraft Java 1.19.2, on a Paper server. Since it is tested on Paper and not Vanilla, things Paper affects like update order are not mentioned here. (It is an advanced feature that no beginner should learn anyway)

The structure of this guide goes as follows - Each chapter of this guide pertains to a certain stage of your learning. For example, "First Steps" is a chapter that tells you how to get started with Redstone, as well as the fundamental concepts.

Each chapter has different _pages_ and each page is about one concept. For example, "First Steps" has a [Signals](../first_steps/signals.md) page that explains what Redstone signals are. At the end of every page, you will build a functioning Redstone build yourself. In this case, at the end of [Signals](../first_steps/signals.md), you will build a lighting system. After the functioning build, you will be given a summary of what you have learned. Finally, you will be given several optional challenges which require you to research or experiment yourself.
